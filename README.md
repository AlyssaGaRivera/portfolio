# Portfolio
Hi, 

My name is Alyssa Rivera. I'm from San Diego, California. Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at San Diego State University. 

My goal is to become a software engineer for a video game company. I grew up with video games and would like to contribute to the future of my passion in any way possible. I'm especially interested in games with a rich story as I feel like video games are meant to have characters
the player can connect with and a world/environment that feels real and immersive. Currently, my favorite video games include Dragon Age, Overwatch, and Valorant. 

As a side project, two of my friends and I are working on releasing our own video games. We're learning the entire process, from concept art to designing mechanics. At the moment, we are still in the early stages of our first release. We hope to have a solid alpha test sometime
next year.

As of now, I work on campus. However, I'm interested in applying internships in order to get a headstart on my career path.

Attached to this repository is my resume.

Thank you for reading my portfolio,
Alyssa Rivera
